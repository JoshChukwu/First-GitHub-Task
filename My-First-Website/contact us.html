        <p> How you operate. If you offer a service, explain your business model or how your products are made. If you have a unique way of doing things, show it. This builds credibility with shoppers and helps you stand out against competitors.
        The face of your business. Feature photos of the founders or key people on your team. Customers like to see who they are buying from or working with.
        Persuasive content. Consider what step you’d like readers to take next. Use additional content and calls to action to move them forward towards that goal. This could include buttons, testimonials, an explainer video, data visualizations, links to blog posts, products, your social media accounts or newsletter.
        Your About Us page is going to be about you, but that doesn’t mean you can’t borrow some ideas from others, especially when it comes to structure and design.
        
        The following are examples of different ways you can tackle your About Us page design.In contrast to a landing page, your About Us page should focus more on your brand identity and less on sales. Here are some components to include:
        
        Your brand story. Tell shoppers the origin story of your business and why you started it. For the most impact, make it memorable and personal, so customers relate and connect with your brand.
        Who you serve. What do you offer and who is it for? Help shoppers see the value of your product or service by sharing how it solves problems or needs.

         A "Meet the Team" page is a tab on a company's website devoted to introducing a company's employees to customers. This webpage also allows visitors to learn more about executives managing a company, which can establish credibility and promote transparency. Customers may prefer supporting a company that prioritizes availability and accountability.

Having a "Meet the Team" page can also offer a competitive advantage over other companies that may not include this page on their websites. If a customer can see the faces of employees, they may be more likely to relate to that business and develop a professional relationship with those who work there. Depending on the size of a business, these pages can highlight an entire team or solely executive personnel.

        The aesthetics of a website directly impacts a user’s opinion of the site and the company. Research shows it takes visitors less than one second to judge a website, and that first impression is often associated with the brand. Seventy-five percent of consumers admit to judging a brand’s credibility based on its website, according to a research summary from the Stanford Persuasive Technology Lab [1].
As a result, companies are putting more emphasis on website design, and it’s reflected in the job market. Jobs in this field are growing 23 percent faster than the national average, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) [2].
