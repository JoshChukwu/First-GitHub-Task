    <p>
      You might dread building teamwork, and you might be thinking, is teamwork
      important for my business? While trust falls, and escape rooms might seem
      like a waste of time, the truth is building teamwork is essential for
      businesses focused on success. When your team works together, they can
      achieve way more than they ever could on their own. Think about your
      biggest wins over the last year. Chances are, it wasn't just the work of
      one employee. A teammate probably helped brainstorm with the person
      working on the idea, gave them feedback that made it even better, or
      worked with them side by side to execute it. <b>Teamwork allows employees
      with diverse skills</b>, experiences, and ways of thinking to combine their
      skills and efforts and create new concepts and fresh ideas for the same
      goal. So, the next time you wonder if the whole team needs to do another
      team building exercise, embrace the thought. Those diverse skills and
      shared experiences are what turn lone team members into a high-functioning
      team that can do remarkable things together. Now, let's get into the
      importance of teamwork...You might dread building teamwork, and you might

    <h3>NOMINEES</h3>
    <img src="assets/img/noninees.jpg" alt="" />
    <p>
      My nominee brings strong assets to their role and our group is incredibly
      fortunate to have them as our administrator. First, they are dedicated and
      hardworking. They are extremely organized and focused on continuously
      learning and developing best practices to manage routine activities both
      efficiently and effectively. They bring a positive high energy and a
      personal touch. When I began my term as chair, they had developed
      processes and procedures over the years for managing our department that
      thoroughly impressed me. This brings consistency, as department chairs
      rotate, and helps each of us to start our term running, rather than
      scrambling to orient ourselves. They bring true professional attributes to
      Ross and genuinely care about delivering excellent quality work. They
      strive to integrate both an understanding of the big picture strategy and
      goals (for the school, for the department), as well as attention to
      details. Many times over the last few years, I have approached them on a
      non-standard matter with only a vague idea in my mind of what we needed or
      wanted to do. They took the initiative to figure out what the area needed
      with minimal guidance from me, and then delivered on the task as well.
      They also always go above and beyond the call of duty in pursuing
      excellence. For example, in supporting our department retreat, they
      collaborated with the departmental committee as a team member and found
      creative ways to support the vision of the event with regards to the
      venue. The event received rave reviews by all and helped build the culture
      of our department. My nominee easily develops and fosters relationships
      with faculty, doctoral students, and our guests. They actively participate
      in meetings and events; their participation enables them to understand the
      departments’ implicit needs and initiate ideas to support our efforts.
      They are terrific in welcoming our new faculty members and doctoral
      students, helping them adjust to the Ross School and Ann Arbor more
      generally. Likewise, our guest speakers and recruiting candidates
      encounter high quality facilitation of travel and accommodation, a
      welcoming personal hello, and we get rave reviews from them.
